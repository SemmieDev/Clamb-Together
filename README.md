# Clamb-Together

A multiplayer mod for Clamb.

## Installation

1. Install Melonloader v0.6.6 (using the [installer](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader.Installer/releases/latest/download/MelonLoader.Installer.exe) is the easiest option).
2. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/SemmieDev/Clamb-Together/releases/latest/download/Clamb-Together.zip).
3. Extract the contents of the archive into Clamb's installation folder.

## Usage

Launch Clamb like normal, and either continue or start a new game. Once the map loaded, pause the game. If everything is installed correctly, there will be a new button labeled "Together".
Press it, and a new menu will open up. In there you control the entire mod. You can now either join an existing lobby, or create your own.
